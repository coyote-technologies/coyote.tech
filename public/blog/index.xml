      <description>A 10x engineer is defined as someone with the effectiveness of 10 average engineers.&#xA;While the idea is a bit of a meme, and debatable if it practically exists. There are some actionable concepts you can apply to your own career to 10x yourself.&#xA;My background is in electrical and hardware engineering, and I later transitioned into software, so I have had the privilege of working with a broad spectrum of teams and organizations.</description>

      <description>Hello [corporate drone], have you completed your annual HR training yet? Are you a corporate worker-bee beleagured by annual corporate web-based trainings that are mandated by email-job-having, real-estate-side-hustling, human-resource-gestapo that have nothing better to do than prevent you from creating value for the shareholders?&#xA;Are you sick and tired of having to spend 1-2 hours per year clicking through sexual harassment trainings when you are already highly skilled at sexual harassment?</description>

      <title>The Cult of Done</title>

      <description>The cult of done is one of our core philosophies Originally authored by Bre Pettis and Kio Stark in 2009 (in 20 minutes, since they had to get it done!)&#xA;There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done. There is no editing stage. Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it.</description>
