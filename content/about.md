Coyote Technologies is a group of engineers united by a single mission, **get things done.** We abide by the [cult of done](/blog/cult-of-done/).

We are a group of experts spanning the different engineering disciplines with decades of individual experience that can be leveraged to meet your business needs.

We have brought products to market in every domain, from software, hardware, physical prototyping, and everything in between. 

We can do everything in-house, from accounting and project management, to development, testing, production, manufacturing, and licensing, and provide you with deliverables on a timeline that fits your schedule.

Whatever your product idea or project is, we are available to help turn your ideas, into reality.

Consultations with us are **always** free, and we often take on interesting projects pro bono, so don't let budget concerns stop you. 

We love to solve problems, [get in touch!](/contact)
